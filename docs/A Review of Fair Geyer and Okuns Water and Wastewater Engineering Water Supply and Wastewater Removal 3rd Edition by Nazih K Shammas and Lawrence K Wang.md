# A Review of Fair, Geyer, and Okun's, Water and Wastewater Engineering: Water Supply and Wastewater Removal, 3rd Edition by Nazih K. Shammas and Lawrence K. Wang
 
Water and wastewater engineering is a vital discipline that deals with the design, operation, and maintenance of systems for providing clean and safe water for various purposes. The field is constantly evolving due to the challenges posed by urbanization, industrialization, climate change, and environmental regulations. Therefore, engineers need to keep up with the latest developments and practices in this area.

One of the classic texts that has been widely used by students and practitioners of water and wastewater engineering is Fair, Geyer, and Okun's, Water and Wastewater Engineering: Water Supply and Wastewater Removal. The first edition of this book was published in 1966 by Gordon M. Fair, John C. Geyer, and Daniel A. Okun, who were eminent professors and consultants in the field. The book covered the fundamental principles and applications of water and wastewater engineering in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.
 
The second edition of the book was published in 1971 with minor revisions and updates. However, since then, the field has undergone significant changes and advancements that required a major overhaul of the book. Therefore, the third edition of the book was published in 2010 by Nazih K. Shammas and Lawrence K. Wang, who are also renowned experts and educators in the field. They have revised and updated the book to reflect the current state of the art and practice of water and wastewater engineering.
 
The third edition of the book consists of 11 chapters that cover the following topics:
 
- Introduction to water systems
- Water sources: surface water
- Water sources: groundwater
- Quantities of water and wastewater flows
- Water hydraulics
- Water distribution systems
- Water distribution systems: modeling and computer applications
- Pumping storage and dual water systems
- Cross connection control
- Introduction to wastewater systems
- Hydrology rainfall and runoff

The book also includes access to an academic version of the commercial software Haestad Methods Water Solutions by Bentley, which is a powerful tool for modeling and designing water distribution systems. The book also includes homework problems at the end of each chapter to reinforce the concepts and skills learned.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style that makes it easy to follow and understand. The book uses both U.S. and SI units throughout and provides equations, examples, and problems in both systems. The book also provides references to relevant literature and websites for further reading and information.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of civil engineering, environmental engineering, water resources engineering, and related disciplines. It is also a valuable reference for practicing engineers, consultants, managers, planners, regulators, researchers, and educators who are involved in water and wastewater engineering.
